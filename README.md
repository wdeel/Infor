list.py includes the first problem presented during the interview.  It 
iterates through the list and checks to see if it already exists in the 
dictionary.  It it is not, the number is added a the key with a value of 1
indicating how many occurences the number occurs in the list.  Otherwise,
the number is already in the dictionary, and the number of occurences 
(the value of the dictionary) is incremented by one.

Ran with Python version 3.6.9
